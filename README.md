## <a name="installation"></a> Installation
This code uses the following libraries:
- pandas 
- numpy
- json
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- imblearn
- sklearn
- statsmodels
- warnings
- shap

This code should run without issues with Python 3.7.10.

## <a name="motivation"></a> Project Motivation
This notebook has been created to better understand how companies select which offers to use and which customers to send them to.

I create and train a Logistic Regression model to look at which factors are the most important in whether or not an offer is used.

## <a name="files"></a> File Descriptions
Apart from the README file, there is only one notebook in this repository. It contains the code to I used to generate all outputs used in my analysis.

## <a name="results"></a> Results
I have written a blog post discussing my findings [here](https://amberstandish.medium.com/flat-white-steep-growth-predicting-customer-response-to-price-discounts-with-starbucks-data-879a6c2b6dd7).
